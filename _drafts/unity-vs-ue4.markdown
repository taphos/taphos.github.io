Modern game engines boost the indie game development community. 38% of all games ever released on steam were released last year (according to [Steam Spy](https://twitter.com/Steam_Spy/status/804072335997358084)). Clear market leaders are currently [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com) and [Unity](https://unity3d.com). I see young developers struggle choosing the right engine for their projects while there are no good information out there to help them. All comparisions I could find online boil down to comparing feature sets, default visuals and licenses. Some even say the technology is the matter of taste, while choosing a wrong engine could be damaging for your project. In this article I will talk about things which are usually ignored in comparisions.

Lets start with the engine creators. UE4 is developed by industry veterans, Epic Games is originated from North Carolina, USA and is widely known for their first and third person shooters. On the other hand Unity originated from Denmark and initially developed by a couple of students who had no gamedev experience what so ever. Lack of developers experience could be at the same time a good and a bad thing. Worth to mention that North Carolina is one of the most conservative US states while Denmark is one of the most liberal countries in Europe.

UE4 developers have exclusively FPS and TPS (lets call it single character perspective games) background. The whole engine architecture and all manuals are written with this perspective, as a game developer you are forced to follow the predefined architecture called [Gameplay framework](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Framework/). While strict architecture could be a good thing, the First Person Shooter oriented architecture could kill your creativity as a young developer. If you would like to build a unique custom gameplay mechanics you might end up fighting with the engine all the way. Unity is much more flexible, it does not have a builtin gameplay architecture. This could be a struggle for developers who do not know how to design architecture on their own but it allows to experiment and make your game unique.
 
First Person Shooters aren't bad, this just probably not the best genre choice for the indie game developer. There is a reason why best FPS games are made by large US companies. Firstly the idea of being single hero against the world is deeply embedded in american mentality (checkout a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os3lWIuGsXE) by [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/user/ExtraCreditz) for more about this) and secondly single character perspective games proved to be profitable and are exploited by large companies. There is no point to fight with industry leaders, you will be crushed by competitors budget. As an indie developer you have to use the power large companies lack, the ability to experiment and innovate. Large companies often afraid to loose their multi-million budget so they tend choose a safe path.
