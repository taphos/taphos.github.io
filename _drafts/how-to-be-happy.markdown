In may 2016 United Nation released its annual happiness report

Currently there is no universal agreement among psychologists, politicians and common citizens about what hapiness is. Hapiness considered to be personal. Rarely governments consider citizens happiness as a goal and if it happens, goals is never achieved. 

Modern western society concentrated on achieving personal happiness. What can we do on the society level or even global level to help? Is it possible at all to produce happy people on the industrial scale?

Often happyness is measured by the standard of living, amount of wealth, social support etc. Do these parameters actually reflect the level of happiness of people in the society? Lets take a couple of examples: for example finland is widely considered one of the wealthiest and best governed countries in the world, hight standard of living, social care, innovative child education. But as my experience shown finish people are often deeply dissatisfied with their lives while it seems they have everything they need to feel happy. In fact finland is near the top in the list of countries by suicide rate. Lets take Botswana, an african country with very low standard of living is placed near the end of the list by suicide rate.
 
 While suicide rate by itself is not a reliable indicator of hapiness (it is much influenced by cultural and religious factors), it shows that our current understanding of human well being and life satisfaction is far from perfect.
 
 I was born in Estonia, one of the former Soviet Union states during 'Perestroika' period, the time of political and economic agony. After USSR collapse the period of chaos followed, high crime rate, low standard of living, income inequality, poor social support, uncapable government. etc. This period lasted through whole of my childhood. Basically I was risen in the 3rd world country. 
 
 (When travelling to 3rd world countries as a tourist, I see people living in a dirt without sanitary. etc. being happy at the same time. I see how other tourists react, they can not immagine the lives of locals. I can)
 
 During my life time Estonia changed from an unpredictable ruined criminal state to a respected European Union member with highly developed IT sector and booming startup culture. Though the level of living is still much lower from Finland, it has a lower suicide rate. Why is that? 
 
 When talking about happiness, seems standard of living does not play a significant role, the change of standard play the role. The derivative value of standard of living is unfortunatelly overlooked by most social studies and should be studied deeper.
 
 Finnish current school education system is dedicated to making kinds happier. It is widely considered as an innovative. In my opinion it is deeply wrong. It creates a totally non stress resistant society which is doomed to be unhappy and unsatisfied with their lives.
  
  Same effect can be seen in other aspects of human brain activity. For example temperature feels colder when it is falling and hotter while rising, despite the opposite absolute measurements.
 
 Using this idea, how could government help the society to rise the happiness level. Special kind of education should be provided. From the childhood people should be educated for stress resistance, they should know whats the low standard life feels like. During the life time people must see the positive progess. 
 
 United States has a low social support for its citizens, thus unintentionally educating society of stress and failure. In fact US has a lower suicide rate then most EU countries. While this system educates people to be happy, it is unsupervised and can accidentally make psychological damage. Situation must be taken under professional control. Professional psychologists should guide the program in order to balance the stress education without making a damage. This kind of education program should not end after graduation, it should continue during the whole society member life time. 
 
 
 Something similar to Shepard tone effect (the illusion of constantly rising audio tone) could be used to create a feeling of constant social progress. Though I am not sure if it is posible. There are studies of similar effects in human visual perception, but no social perception studies as I heard of.
 
 This might sound like an utopian idea with dark future with zombie society. We are still under influence of 20th century antiutopists like Orwell, Zamyatin and Hacksly. Literature helped us to skip the totalitarian future in 20th century, not, it 21st century probably it is time to move on, optimize the social organization and make every ones lives better. I hope that future generation will be free from the personal struggles we are currently facing feel sorry for us, but at the same time thankful for our ideas and progress.
 
 
 
 I might speculate about how modern technologies could help us to develop the above mentioned education program. Virtual Reality seems is be developing rapidly at the moment. Lets assume that in some years the VR technology will be very comfortable to use by anyone, including children and the quality will be near to real life experience. Educating experiences could be developed precisely to make person understand the required level of stress and discomfort without the danger of making a damage. This kind of educating program will be cheap as the cost will be similar to playing a video game. 
 Holywood movie 'Game' 1997 expresses the similar idea, the main character millionair has everything he could wish for, at the same time feeling dissatisfied with his life. His brother makes a present for him, an extreme stressful experience, carefully controlled by team of specialists which brings the taste of life back. Movie demonstrates how a real-life stress gamification can help a person to feel happier, Similar experiences could be setup cheap for everyone, using virtual reality technologies.
 
 If we develop the idea further VR experiences could be used for other kind of education. For example, current academic approach to langiuage learning is proven to be ineffective. The fastest way to learn a language is still the real life among native speakers. VR experience could put a student into this kind of situation without costs of traveling and without the need of changing life style. To learn language faster the stress level may be increased. For example putting student into the situation where his life depends on language knowledge (gamified offcorse). It will activate the hormons required to increase brain activity. For example an experience as a foreigner in the harsh african ghetto, where the knowledge of local language directly increases your chances for survival. In this situation a person could learn basic spoken language in a week.
