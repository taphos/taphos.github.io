It is widely believed that AI requires to obtain consciousness to go out of human control. This could be a misconception. 
We know that modern AI with Deep Learning algorithms can make good quality decisions without really understanding the point of the questions, sometimes better quality than humans.
Now imagine scenario when some political leader tries to use modern AI to make good quality political decisions?

The one that makes good decisions faster and more efficiently, will have an advantage.
If AI is suitable for this task, our pioneer would gain an advantage over competitors, forcing them to use the same technique to keep up.
In the beginning politicians will not trust AI fully, they will be validating each decision manually without giving it direct control.
At some point the speed of decision making might go beyond human brain limits.
At this point leaders would have to decide whether to keep validating decisions and probably loose the competition,
or to give AI direct control to overcome opponents. If at least anyone makes a second choice, decisions will go out of human control.
I know that our leaders have been smart enough not to start the nuclear war having access to technology for atleast 70 years, I might suggest that capabilities of AI could be not so obvious for them. 
Whats if bad choice will be done? I dunno, maybe competing AIs will destroy each other and the world as a bonus.
Or maybe AI will learn that the most optimal way to win is to cooperate, so it may be the end of all wars. At the same time AIs could decide to wipe out humanity in cooperative mode too.

## How really possible is this scenario?

Well, Deep Learning algorithms are open-source and are available for everyone to use: [deepmind.com](https://deepmind.com).
Nowadays DeepMind is a favorite toy of computer science students for better playing video games
(Check out [AI killing human video game players as a superhero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0TraGu6QY)).
What kind of projects will those students be developing when hired by the government after the graduation?
Will those toys be turned into good quality political advisers?

The hard part is the initial input data for computer learning, it will require a database of large number of historical political decisions, their extremely detailed conditions and after results.
I would suggest that database of this kind can be created with an army of historians and political analysts in several years
There are few countries in the world which are capable of development of a project of this scale.
North Korea! No! North Korea will definitely have problems finding historians being able to provide the accurate data :)
Well I am sure same goes atlest partly to USA, Russia and China, while they have bigger talent pool due to larger population.
ISIS was able to assemble west-studied film crew to shoot good quality videos for western media, I bet they are able find good enough scientists too.
These countries are motivated to start the project before other competitors. It is not impossible that one or several of such projects are already in development at the moment
